Rebuttal Round 1:\\n   - Pro rebuttal evaluation: The Pro agent's rebuttal effectively addresses concerns about NASA's documentation and testimony by highlighting multiple independent sources verifying the Apollo missions' findings.\\n   - Con rebuttal evaluation: The Con agent's rebuttal raises valid questions about potential bias and manipulation, but fails to provide concrete evidence or alternative explanations.\\n\\n4. Rebuttal Round 2:\\n   - Pro rebuttal evaluation: The Pro agent's rebuttal attempts to bolster their argument by highlighting multiple independent sources verifying the Apollo missions' findings, but overlooks concerns about potential bias and manipulation.\\n   - Con rebuttal evaluation: The Con agent's rebuttal effectively highlights these concerns, questioning the objectivity of these sources.\\n\\n5. Rebuttal Round 3:\\n   - Pro rebuttal evaluation: The Pro agent's rebuttal attempts to address concerns about bias by highlighting multiple independent sources verifying the Apollo missions' findings, but overlooks the fact that these sources have also been influenced or funded by NASA and the US government.\\n   - Con rebuttal evaluation: The Con agent's rebuttal effectively highlights this oversight, raising significant questions about the objectivity of these sources.\\n\\nWinner declaration with brief rationale: Ben (Con) wins due to his ability to consistently raise valid concerns about potential bias and manipulation, while Ava (Pro) struggled to fully address these concerns and provide concrete evidence to support her claims.\", \"winner\": \"pro\", \"timestamp\": \"2025-05-26T19:24:54.643293\"}",
